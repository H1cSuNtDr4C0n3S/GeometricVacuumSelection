\title{Geometric Vacuum Selection from Constrained Spacetime Foliations}
\author{Michael Spina}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We investigate a scalar-field framework for vacuum structure in General
Relativity, in which the foliation defined by the gradient of a time-ordering
field $\Theta$ is subject to a non-local geometric constraint. The level sets
$\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ define spacelike hypersurfaces interpreted as physical
“present” leaves. The constraint fixes the normalized average of the squared
extrinsic curvature $K^2$ over causally defined domains to a constant scale
$K_0^2$, enforced by a Lagrange multiplier that is constant on each leaf.

We show that this non-local condition acts as a vacuum selection principle:
in the infrared limit it excludes the static Minkowski vacuum, compelling the
ground state to be spontaneously curved. De Sitter spacetime emerges as a
consistent asymptotic vacuum solution, with its expansion rate fixed by the
geometric selection rule $H^2 = K_0^2/3$.

We further demonstrate that the infrared dominance of the constraint ensures
compatibility with local gravitational physics. Standard Schwarzschild and
post-Newtonian limits are recovered for local sources, as the constraint does
not act as a pointwise modification of the gravitational field.

These results suggest that the observed late-time cosmic acceleration may
reflect a global geometric property of the spacetime foliation—a resistance
to staticity—rather than the presence of an additional dynamical dark energy
degree of freedom. While the implications for the early matter-dominated era
remain open for future investigation, this framework offers a novel geometric
perspective on the smallness and non-vanishing nature of the vacuum energy.
\end{abstract}

\subsection*{Conventions}
We work in natural units $c=\hbar=1$ adopting metric signature $(+,-,-,-)$.
Our curvature conventions follow
\begin{equation}
{R^\rho}_{\sigma\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu \Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}-\partial_\nu \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}
+\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma},
\qquad
R_{\mu\nu}={R^\rho}_{\mu\rho\nu}.
\end{equation}
For the nonlocal functional we set the smoothing/window parameter to its default value $W=1$
throughout (no variation with respect to $W$ is performed).

\section{Motivation and scope}

General Relativity provides an accurate local description of gravitational
phenomena, yet it leaves the global structure of time and the selection of
the vacuum largely unconstrained. In particular, both Minkowski and de
Sitter spacetimes are admissible vacuum solutions, despite their radically
different global properties. The observed accelerated expansion is therefore
introduced phenomenologically through a cosmological constant, rather than
emerging from a geometric principle.

In this work we explore a minimal geometric extension of General Relativity
based on a scalar field $\Theta$ whose timelike gradient defines a preferred
foliation of spacetime. Preferred-foliation frameworks closely related in spirit 
include Einstein--\AE ther and khronometric theories, where a timelike vector
 (or scalar-defined) structure selects a preferred slicing while remaining
 compatible with standard local tests in appropriate limits \cite{Jacobson2001,JacobsonMattingly2004,Blas2010,JacobsonLim2014}.
 The level sets $\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ are interpreted
as physical ``present'' hypersurfaces, providing a global time-ordering
structure without affecting local causal relations or observer-dependent
simultaneity.

The central ingredient is a non-local geometric constraint acting on the
foliation itself: the normalized average of the squared extrinsic curvature
$K^2$ over a causally defined domain on each hypersurface is fixed to a
constant value. This leafwise constraint selects the global vacuum geometry
without introducing local modifications of the gravitational field equations.

We show that asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime is excluded in the
infrared limit, while de Sitter spacetime is admitted as a consistent vacuum,
with its expansion rate fixed by the constraint. Local Schwarzschild and
post-Newtonian physics are recovered, as the constraint is dominated by
infrared scales.

The framework developed here is not intended as a complete cosmological
model across all epochs, but as a geometric principle governing the
admissible vacuum structure in the infrared regime. In particular, the
analysis focuses on vacuum selection and late-time asymptotic behavior,
while the coupling of this mechanism to realistic matter-dominated
cosmological histories is left for future investigation.



\section{Geometric setup}

We consider a four-dimensional spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ endowed
with a scalar field $\Theta$. When the gradient $\nabla_\mu \Theta$ is
timelike, the level sets $\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ define a foliation of
spacetime by spacelike hypersurfaces $\Sigma_\Theta$. Scalar fields used to define
preferred time functions and associated foliations in GR have been considered
in earlier contexts; see e.g.\ \cite{Pi2005}.
Throughout this work, we restrict attention to configurations satisfying this condition.

The scalar invariant
\begin{equation}
X \equiv g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Theta\,\partial_\nu\Theta
\end{equation}
is assumed to be positive, ensuring that $\nabla_\mu\Theta$ is timelike.
We then define the unit normal vector field to the foliation as
\begin{equation}
u_\mu \equiv \frac{\partial_\mu \Theta}{\sqrt{X}} \, .
\end{equation}

The induced metric on each hypersurface $\Sigma_\Theta$ is given by
\begin{equation}
h_{\mu\nu} \equiv g_{\mu\nu} - u_\mu u_\nu ,
\end{equation}
which projects tensors onto directions tangent to the foliation. 
We denote by $\gamma_{ij}$ the (positive-definite) induced three-metric on each leaf $\Sigma_\Theta$.
Its determinant is $\gamma \equiv \det(\gamma_{ij})$, and the intrinsic volume element is
$\sqrt{\gamma}\,d^3x$.
The extrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces is defined in the standard way as
\begin{equation}
K_{\mu\nu} \equiv h^\alpha_{\ \mu} h^\beta_{\ \nu} \nabla_\alpha u_\beta .
\end{equation}

A key scalar quantity in what follows is the squared extrinsic curvature,
\begin{equation}
K^2 \equiv K_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu\nu} ,
\end{equation}
which measures the curvature of the $\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ hypersurfaces
within spacetime. Together with the Ricci scalar $R$ of the spacetime
metric, these invariants will enter the action and the geometric constraint
introduced in later sections.


\section{Spherically symmetric sector}

In order to analyze the geometric properties of the $\Theta$-foliation and
to construct explicit examples, we consider a static, spherically symmetric
spacetime. The metric is written in the form
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = A(r)\,dt^2 - B(r)\,dr^2 - r^2\left(d\vartheta^2 + \sin^2\vartheta\,d\varphi^2\right),
\end{equation}
where $A(r)$ and $B(r)$ are positive functions of the radial coordinate.

For the scalar field we adopt the ansatz
\begin{equation}
\Theta(t,r) = t + \psi(r),
\end{equation}
which preserves spherical symmetry while allowing for nontrivial
foliations tilted with respect to the static time coordinate. This form
captures the most general $\Theta$ compatible with the symmetries of the
metric.

\subsection{Kinematic invariant}

For the above ansatz, the kinetic scalar $X$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
X = \frac{1}{A(r)} - \frac{\psi'(r)^2}{B(r)} .
\end{equation}
The requirement that the foliation be spacelike implies $X>0$, which
constrains the admissible profiles $\psi(r)$.

\subsection{Curvature invariants}

The Ricci scalar associated with the metric is given by
\begin{equation}
R = R[A(r),B(r)] ,
\end{equation}
where the explicit expression, though lengthy, depends only on the radial
functions and their derivatives.

The squared extrinsic curvature of the $\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ hypersurfaces
can be written as
\begin{equation}
K^2 = K_{\mu\nu}K^{\mu\nu}
     = K^2\big(A(r),B(r),\psi(r),\psi'(r),\psi''(r)\big) .
\end{equation}
The explicit form is algebraically involved and will not be reproduced in
full here. What is important for our purposes is its dependence on the
radial coordinate through the functions $A(r)$, $B(r)$ and the foliation
profile $\psi(r)$.

These local expressions will enter the construction of the action and the
leafwise geometric constraint discussed in the following sections.

\section{Constrained action}

\subsection{Local gravitational dynamics}

We start from a local action consisting of the Einstein--Hilbert term and a
minimal kinetic term for the scalar field $\Theta$,
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{loc}} =
\int d^4x \sqrt{-g}
\left[
\frac{1}{2\kappa}(R - 2\Lambda)
- \frac{\alpha}{2} X
\right] ,
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = 8\pi G$, $\Lambda$ is a cosmological constant and
$X = g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\Theta\,\partial_\nu\Theta$.
This local action is fully diffeomorphism invariant and does not introduce
any preferred frame by itself.

\paragraph{On the bare cosmological constant.}
We keep $\Lambda$ explicit for generality. In the vacuum-selection discussion below we set the
bare value to $\Lambda=0$, so that the de Sitter curvature scale arises from the leafwise constraint
as a selection rule rather than being put in by hand.

\subsection{Leafwise geometric constraint}

The defining ingredient of the theory is a non-local geometric constraint
acting on the foliation defined by $\Theta$. For each hypersurface
$\Sigma_\Theta$ we consider a causally defined domain
$D_\Theta \subset \Sigma_\Theta$, determined by the spacetime geometry and
the foliation itself.

On each leaf we define the functionals
\begin{equation}
I_0[\Theta] \equiv \int_{D_\Theta} W\,\sqrt{\gamma}\, d^3x ,
\qquad
I_1[\Theta] \equiv \int_{D_\Theta} W\,K^2 \sqrt{\gamma}\, d^3x ,
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is the determinant of the induced three-metric $\gamma_{ij}$ on $\Sigma_\Theta$,
and $W\ge 0$ is an optional smoothing/window weight (set to $W=1$ in this work). Then

\begin{equation}
\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta} \equiv \frac{I_1[\Theta]}{I_0[\Theta]} .
\end{equation}

The geometric constraint is imposed by requiring
\begin{equation}
\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta} = K_0^2 ,
\end{equation}
where $K_0$ is a fixed parameter setting the curvature scale of the foliation.
Conceptually, the use of global (or nonlocal) constraints to control vacuum properties has 
precedents in unimodular formulations and vacuum-energy sequestering mechanisms 
\cite{Alvarez2016,KaloperPadilla2014}. 
The present constraint, however, acts on a foliation-dependent extrinsic-curvature functional
rather than on the metric determinant or on matter-sector vacuum contributions.


\subsection{Full action}

The constraint is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier $\lambda(\Theta)$
that depends only on the value of the scalar field and is therefore constant
on each hypersurface $\Sigma_\Theta$. The full action reads
\begin{equation}
S = S_{\mathrm{loc}}
+ \int d\Theta\, \lambda(\Theta)
\left[
I_1[\Theta] - K_0^2 I_0[\Theta]
\right] .
\end{equation}

Because $\lambda$ is not a local field but a function of $\Theta$ only, the
constraint does not generate a pointwise equation $K^2(x)=K_0^2$. Instead,
it acts globally on the geometry of each leaf, selecting admissible
foliations without modifying the local gravitational dynamics.

\section{Sanity checks and local GR recovery}

\subsection{Schwarzschild test}

As a first consistency check, we evaluate the curvature invariants for the
Schwarzschild solution,
\begin{equation}
A(r)=1-\frac{2M}{r}, \qquad B(r)=\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
The Ricci scalar vanishes identically,
\begin{equation}
R\big|_{\mathrm{Schw}} = 0,
\end{equation}
as expected for a vacuum solution of General Relativity. This confirms that
the local gravitational dynamics is unmodified.
The recovery of standard weak-field and post-Newtonian behavior in the presence 
of preferred-structure fields has been extensively analyzed in related settings; 
see e.g.\ \cite{JacobsonMattingly2004} for an explicit post-Newtonian equivalence
result in Einstein--\AE ther theory.


\subsection{Static foliation limit}

When the foliation coincides with constant-$t$ hypersurfaces
($\psi=\mathrm{const}$), the scalar invariants reduce to
\begin{align}
X\big|_{\psi'=0} &= \frac{1}{A(r)}, \\
K^2\big|_{\psi'=0} &= 0.
\end{align}
In this limit the extrinsic curvature of the $\Theta$-hypersurfaces vanishes
identically, and the local field equations reduce exactly to those of General
Relativity. This shows that static foliations in static spacetimes are
locally indistinguishable from GR, irrespective of the presence of the
global geometric constraint.

\section{Vacuum selection from the leafwise constraint}

\subsection{Minkowski spacetime}

We now evaluate the leafwise geometric functional for Minkowski spacetime,
written in static spherical coordinates,
\begin{equation}
A(r)=1, \qquad B(r)=1.
\end{equation}
For foliations of the form $\Theta=t+\psi(r)$ the kinetic invariant becomes
\begin{equation}
X = 1-\psi'(r)^2,
\end{equation}
so that the timelike condition requires $|\psi'(r)|<1$.

For a linear tilt $\psi(r)=vr$, one finds
\begin{equation}
K^2(r)=\frac{2v^2}{r^2(1-v^2)},
\end{equation}
which is strictly positive but decays as $r^{-2}$ at large radius.

\subsection{Infrared behaviour of the leafwise average}

The leafwise constraint does not involve the pointwise value of $K^2(r)$,
but its normalized average over a causally defined domain $D_\Theta$,
\begin{equation}
\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta}
=\frac{\int_{D_\Theta} W\,K^2\sqrt{\gamma}\,d^3x}
{\int_{D_\Theta} W\,\sqrt{\gamma}\,d^3x}.
\end{equation}

In Minkowski spacetime, the induced volume element grows as
$\sqrt{\gamma}\sim r^2$, while $K^2\sim r^{-2}$. As a consequence, the numerator
scales linearly with the infrared cutoff, whereas the denominator grows
cubically. In the infrared limit one therefore finds
\begin{equation}
\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{IR}} 0.
\end{equation}

This result holds independently of the tilt parameter $v$ and reflects a
purely geometric scaling property of asymptotically flat spacetime.
This infrared scaling mechanism is qualitatively reminiscent of other approaches 
where large-scale (IR) effects can drive late-time acceleration without introducing a
new local dark-energy field, albeit implemented here as a geometric selection rule 
rather than as a dynamical nonlocal modification of the field equations \cite{KaloperPadilla2014}.
Therefore, Minkowski spacetime cannot satisfy the leafwise constraint
$\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta}=K_0^2$ for any $K_0^2>0$.

\subsection{de Sitter spacetime}

We next consider de Sitter spacetime in the static patch,
\begin{equation}
A(r)=1-H^2 r^2, \qquad B(r)=\left(1-H^2 r^2\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
For the Painlev\'e--Gullstrand slicing,
\begin{equation}
\psi'(r)=\frac{Hr}{1-H^2 r^2},
\end{equation}
the kinetic invariant satisfies $X=1$, and the squared extrinsic curvature
of the $\Theta$-hypersurfaces is constant,
\begin{equation}
K^2 = 3H^2.
\end{equation}

Since $K^2$ is constant on the entire causal domain of the static patch, its
normalized leafwise average coincides with the local value,
\begin{equation}
\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta} = 3H^2.
\end{equation}
The leafwise constraint therefore selects de Sitter spacetime as an
admissible vacuum, with the expansion rate fixed by
\begin{equation}
H^2=\frac{K_0^2}{3}.
\end{equation}

This relation should be interpreted as fixing the curvature scale of the
vacuum geometry selected by the leafwise constraint, rather than as enforcing
a constant Hubble parameter throughout the entire cosmological history.
The result characterizes the asymptotic vacuum structure in the infrared
regime, independently of the intermediate matter- or radiation-dominated
phases.


\subsection{Infrared dominance of the leafwise constraint}

At this stage a potential concern may arise. Since the leafwise constraint
fixes a non-zero value of the normalized average $\langle K^2\rangle_{D_\Theta}$,
one might worry that local Schwarzschild or post-Newtonian physics could be
incompatible with the theory. This concern, however, relies on an incorrect
interpretation of the constraint as a local condition.

The geometric constraint does not act pointwise on $K^2$, but only through
its leafwise average over a causally defined domain. As a result, its effect
is controlled by the large-scale structure of the foliation rather than by
local curvature near compact sources. In the following we show explicitly
that, for physically relevant foliations, the induced geometry on the
$\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ hypersurfaces remains locally Euclidean, ensuring
full compatibility with standard Schwarzschild and post-Newtonian physics.


\begin{lemma}[Euclidean induced metric on the SdS--PG foliation]
\label{lem:euclidean-sds-pg}
Consider the static Schwarzschild--de Sitter line element
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = A(r)\,dt^2 - B(r)\,dr^2 - r^2 d\Omega^2,
\qquad
A(r)=1-\frac{2M}{r}-H^2 r^2,
\qquad
B(r)=\frac{1}{A(r)}.
\label{eq:sds-static}
\end{equation}
Let the foliation be defined by the scalar field
\begin{equation}
\Theta(t,r)=t+\psi(r),
\label{eq:theta-foliation}
\end{equation}
and choose the Painlev\'e--Gullstrand--type slicing
\begin{equation}
\psi'(r)=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{2M}{r}+H^2 r^2}}{A(r)}.
\label{eq:psi-prime-pg-sds}
\end{equation}
Then the metric induced on the hypersurfaces $\Sigma_\Theta:\ \Theta=\mathrm{const}$ is exactly Euclidean:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{ij}\,dx^i dx^j = dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2,
\qquad\text{hence}\qquad
\sqrt{\gamma}=r^2\sin\theta.
\label{eq:euclidean-induced}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
On a hypersurface $\Theta=\mathrm{const}$ we have $d\Theta = dt+\psi'(r)\,dr=0$, hence
\begin{equation}
dt = -\psi'(r)\,dr.
\label{eq:dt-on-leaf}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{eq:dt-on-leaf} into \eqref{eq:sds-static}, the induced line element on $\Sigma_\Theta$ becomes
\begin{equation}
ds^2\big|_{\Sigma_\Theta}
= \big(B(r)-A(r)\psi'(r)^2\big)\,dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2.
\label{eq:induced-general}
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{eq:psi-prime-pg-sds} and $B=1/A$, we compute
\begin{align}
B(r)-A(r)\psi'(r)^2
&= \frac{1}{A(r)} - A(r)\,\frac{\frac{2M}{r}+H^2 r^2}{A(r)^2}
= \frac{1-\left(\frac{2M}{r}+H^2 r^2\right)}{A(r)}.
\label{eq:key-computation-1}
\end{align}
Finally, since $A(r)=1-\frac{2M}{r}-H^2 r^2$, the numerator in \eqref{eq:key-computation-1} equals $A(r)$ and therefore
\begin{equation}
B(r)-A(r)\psi'(r)^2 = \frac{A(r)}{A(r)}=1.
\label{eq:key-identity}
\end{equation}
Substituting \eqref{eq:key-identity} into \eqref{eq:induced-general} yields \eqref{eq:euclidean-induced}.
\end{proof}

As a consequence, the leafwise geometric constraint is dominated by the
large-scale structure of the foliation, while local Schwarzschild and
post-Newtonian physics remain unaffected. The apparent tension between the
constraint and local gravity is therefore resolved at the geometric level.

\section{Covariance and preferred foliation backgrounds}

The formalism is generally covariant at the level of the action, but
backgrounds for which $\nabla_\mu\Theta$ is timelike naturally select a
preferred foliation of spacetime. This mechanism is conceptually related to
those appearing in Einstein--Æther theories \cite{Jacobson2001},
Hořava--Lifshitz gravity \cite{Horava2009}, and khronometric models
\cite{Blas2010}.

Although the foliation is defined by the gradient of a scalar field, the
present framework differs from khronometric and scalar Einstein--Æther
theories in a crucial way. The field $\Theta$ is not introduced as an
independent dynamical degree of freedom with its own kinetic couplings, but
serves a purely geometric role in defining the hypersurfaces on which the
global constraint acts. Related scalar-aether and khronometric constructions,
used for comparison, are discussed for instance in \cite{JacobsonLim2014,Blas2024}.

The breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is therefore spontaneous rather than
fundamental. The action remains fully diffeomorphism invariant, while
specific solutions dynamically single out a preferred time direction
through the gradient of $\Theta$. In this sense, the preferred foliation does
not represent a violation of covariance at the level of physical laws, but
emerges as a property of the vacuum geometry selected by the leafwise
constraint.

\section{Computational details}

All symbolic computations presented in this work were performed using
\textit{Wolfram Mathematica}~14.3 on Wolfram Cloud. The calculations are
organized in a sequence of notebooks implementing independent checks of the
geometric invariants, the local action, and the evaluation of the leafwise
constraint in symmetric settings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{00\_Setup\_Assumptions.nb} - Global assumptions and symbol definitions.
\item \texttt{01\_Invariants\_X\_K2\_R.nb} - Computation of $X$, $K^2$, and $R$ from the metric ansatz.
\item \texttt{02\_Action\_Lagrangian.nb} - Construction of the local \\ 
four-dimensional Lagrangian and of the leafwise constraint functional.
\item \texttt{03\_Leff\_Radial\_Reduction.nb} - Angular integration and construction of the
radial kernels entering the leafwise averages.
\item \texttt{04\_SanityChecks.nb} - Verification of limiting cases (Schwarzschild, $\psi'=0$).
\item \texttt{05\_Test\_Minkowski.nb} - Evaluation of the leafwise average in \\ Minkowski spacetime
and analysis of its infrared behaviour.
\item \texttt{06\_Test\_deSitter.nb} - Verification that de Sitter spacetime satisfies the
leafwise constraint through a cosmological (Painlev\'e--Gullstrand) slicing.
\end{enumerate}

An additional notebook, \texttt{GR\_Spherical\_Foliation\_K2\_R.nb}, provides an
independent derivation of the geometric invariants through explicit
construction of the Christoffel symbols, Riemann tensor, and extrinsic
curvature tensor $K_{\mu\nu}$.

The notebooks are provided as supplementary material.

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a scalar-field framework in which the foliation defined by
the gradient of $\Theta$ is subject to a non-local geometric constraint acting
leafwise on spacetime hypersurfaces. The constraint fixes the normalized
average of the squared extrinsic curvature over causally defined domains,
rather than imposing a pointwise condition on the geometry.

While the theory locally reproduces the field equations of General Relativity
when the foliation aligns with static time coordinates, the leafwise
constraint leads to a non-trivial selection of the vacuum structure. In
particular, asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime is excluded in the
infrared limit, whereas de Sitter spacetime is admitted as a consistent
vacuum, with its expansion rate fixed by the geometric selection rule
$H^2 = K_0^2/3$.

Crucially, the constraint is dominated by infrared scales and does not act as
a local modification of the gravitational field. As a result, standard
Schwarzschild and post-Newtonian physics are fully recovered, and no
additional local degrees of freedom or force terms are introduced.

These results suggest that the observed late-time cosmic acceleration may
reflect a global geometric property of the spacetime foliation defining the
present, rather than requiring the introduction of an additional dynamical
dark energy degree of freedom. In this sense, the effect can be understood as
a property of the vacuum geometry selected by the constraint, rather than as
a new local source in the gravitational field equations. More general
spacetimes and the role of perturbations around the selected vacuum are left
for future investigation.
